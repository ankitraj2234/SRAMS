# SRAMS: Secure Role-Based Access Management System
### *Enterprise-Grade Document Security & Access Control*

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
**SRAMS** is a high-security document management platform designed to solve the critical challenge of **secure information dissemination** in enterprise environments. Unlike standard document storage solutions, SRAMS prioritizes **granular access control, strict session management, and irrevocable audit trails**.

Built with a focus on **Zero Trust architecture**, it implements a unique **Dual-Interface Security Model** where standard users access the system via the web, while administrative privileges are strictly gated behind a custom-built secure Desktop Launcher.

## 💎 Key Innovations & Unique Selling Points

### 1. The "Desktop-Gated" Security Model
*   **Unique Feature:** Super Admin capabilities are **physically restricted** to a custom Electron-based Desktop Launcher.
*   **Mechanism:** The backend strictly rejects administrative commands unless they carry cryptographically signed headers (`X-Desktop-Session`, `X-Device-ID`) that are only generated by the compiled desktop binary.
*   **Impact:** Eliminates the risk of web-based XSS/CSRF attacks compromising the root administration account, a common vulnerability in web-only CMS platforms.

### 2. High-Fidelity Dynamic Watermarking Engine
*   **Technology:** Custom canvas-based rendering engine overlaying `PDF.js`.
*   **Dynamic Content:** Watermarks are generated in real-time containing:
    *   **Observer Identity:** Viewer's Full Name & ID.
    *   **Traceability Data:** Viewer's IP Address & Precise Timestamp.
    *   **Branding:** Custom uploaded Organization Logo.
*   **Smart Rendering:**  Uses advanced **composite blending modes** (Multiply) to ensure watermark visibility without obscuring document text. Features an intelligent "First-Render" logic to prevent canvas race conditions.
*   **Configuration:** Admin-controlled opacity slider (1-100%) and content toggles.

### 3. Forensic-Level Audit Logging
*   **Immutable Logs:** Every single interaction is recorded—from login attempts and password changes to individual page views inside a document.
*   **Page-Level Tracking:** The system tracks exactly *which pages* a user viewed and for how long, providing granular read receipts.
*   **Tamper Evidence:** Audit logs are serialized and stored with action metadata, ready for compliance audits.

### 4. Zero-Leak Document Viewer
*   **No-Download Policy:** Documents are streamed as binary blobs and rendered directly in memory. The original PDF file is never exposed as a direct download link.
*   **Protection Suite:**
    *   Right-click disabled.
    *   Print functionality disabled.
    *   Browser "Save As" intercepted.
    *   Clip-path masking to discourage screen scraping.

## 🔮 Scalability & Future Potential
*Designed with modularity to support enterprise expansion:*

*   **Multi-Tenancy:** The current database schema supports easy migration to a tenant_id based model for SaaS delivery.
*   **AI Access Analysis:**  The rich audit log data provides the perfect dataset for training ML models to detect anomalous access patterns (User Behavior Analytics - UBA).
*   **Blockchain Integration:**  Audit logs can be easily hashed to a blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger) for legally binding immutability.
*   **Smart Document Search:** Integration with vector databases (e.g., Pinecone) to allow semantic search within secure PDF content.
